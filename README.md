    <strong> Firefox DevTools Colour Theme</strong>
</h1>
A quite pleasing-to-look at theme. An almost one-to-one recreation of the theme found in Mozilla Firefox's developer tools.
<br> <br>

Intended for hours and hours of work. Try this theme yourself, and you'll never want to go back to other themes (at least I don't.)
